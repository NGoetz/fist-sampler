# Whether to recalculate T and \mu along the hypersurface to match energy abd baryon density from hydro

# Use (or not) the fast mode when checking the hard-core overlap of particles. 
# If on, keeps sampling the given particle until no overlap with other particles achieved.
# Otherwise, in case of an overlap, all of the already sampled particles are rejected and one starts over.
# The fast mode appears to be very accurate compared to the full method, and currently it is needed for
# the sampling of (semi-)central collisions where the full method is prohibitively expensive.
